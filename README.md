# Briscola

My attempt to create an AI which plays the Italian card game Briscola.

## Description

I used to play this game a lot at university with my Computer Science and Engineering classmates.
I therefore decided to recreate the game and implement an AI through ML algorithms that could learn how to play.

The game is fairly easy and it can be played by 2, 3, 4 or even 5 people at each time.

## v1.0.0

I coded the first version in 2018, while still at university. I used it to learn and practice python.
The game is only playable from the terminal window, it must be a 1v1 and the AI is fully scripted, there is no ML involved.
