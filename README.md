# Briscola

My attempt to create an AI which plays the Italian card game Briscola.

## Description

I used to play this game a lot at university with my Computer Science and Engineering classmates.
I therefore decided to recreate the game and implement an AI through ML algorithms that could learn how to play.

The game is fairly easy and it can be played by 2, 3, 4 or even 5 people at each time.

## v2.0.0

Created an environment with OpenAI gym to mimic the game dynamics.
Game is playable from 2 to 4 players (no teams allowed). Human and Random Agents have been created.

### ONext steps

- Create and train Reinforcement Learning agent.
